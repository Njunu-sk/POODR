Combining Objects with Composition
Composistion is the act of combining distinct parts into whole such that the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.
Composed objects tend to consist of simple, discrete entities that can be easily be rearranged into new combinations, these objects are easy to understand, reuse and test but because they are combined into a more complicated whole, the operations of the bigger application may not be asy to understand as that of individual parts.
