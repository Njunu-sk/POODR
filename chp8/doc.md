## Combining Objects with Composition

- Composistion is the act of combining distinct parts into whole such that the whole becomes more than the sum of its parts.
- Composed objects tend to consist of simple, discrete entities that can be easily be rearranged into new combinations, these objects are easy to understand, reuse and test but because they are combined into a more complicated whole, the operations of the bigger application may not be easy to understand as that of individual parts.

- `Factory` this is an object that creates other objects.

- `Delegation` this is when one object receives a message and merely forwards it to another.

- `A composed object` this is an object made up of parts with which it expects to interact via well-defined interfaces.
